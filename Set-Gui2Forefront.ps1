  Notes:
  - This was helpful in understanding how to create the one version of the code below:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4993926/maximize-window-and-bring-it-in-front-with-powershell
    - I did find that "ShowWindowAsync" didn't work consistently... doing a "Start-Sleep 2" seemed to help, but the results weren't consistent and I had to run the code twice to get the desired effect
    - Nevertheless, the link above gave me the basis code and I did get some results...
    - There was helpful comment in the link above mentioning the use of "SwitchToThisWindow", which I then started to explore

  - This was helpful in supplying further discussion about "SwitchToThisWindow","SetForegroundWindow", and citing an interesting link from Lee Holmes regarding P/Invoke (https://www.leeholmes.com/blog/2006/07/25/more-pinvoke-in-powershell/); the link to that forum post is here:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2556872/how-to-set-foreground-window-from-powershell-event-subscriber-action
