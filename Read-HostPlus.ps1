.SYNOPSIS
  The "Read-HostPlus" function allows the storage of a plain text string to variable in the terminal while obfuscating the characters.

.EXAMPLE
  PS C:\> $test = Read-HostPlus
  Input the text you want obfuscated
  : *********************************************************
  PS C:\> $test
  This text I didn't want to be logged at the command line



  Here we run the function and type in the text that we didn't want displayed in the terminal.  We save it to a variable, and then can use that variable just as we would a normal string.
